+ key naming convention, using example "firstKeyword.secondKeyword.thirdKeyword"
+ all names should follow the camelCase standard
+
+ firstKeyword should always be the group the string is in, example: "settings, ctw, classes, moderation"
+ secondKeyword should always be the name of the function the string belongs, example "moderation.unmute"
+ thirdKeyword is used for telling which part of the function the string belongs to, example "moderation.unmute.sender" or "moderation.unmute.target"
+ a thirdKeyword is only necessary if multiple strings belong to one function
+
+ long key names should always be avoided for easier reading/searching
+ optionally a explanation can be tagged to a string if needed
+
+ NOTE: Exceptions from these rules happen, death messages beeing one example.

+ EACH STRING WITH VARIABLES NEEDS TO HAVE A EXPLANATION FOR EACH VARIABLE IN THE FORM OF:
+ # {0} = explanation
+ # {1} = explanation
+ # {n}...

+ NOTE: Using "+" in front of comments will make them not appear on Crowdin or in any other place
